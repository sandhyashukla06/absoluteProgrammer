    <h3>ES6</h3>
    <p>The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a 
        scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; initially
        it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.
        In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript
        in a press release. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the
        Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language
        standard have been published since then. The name "ECMAScript" was a
        compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the 
        language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated
        the early standards sessions.</p>
